# Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model
This repository contains code for simulating and analyzing the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model, which is a cellular automaton model used for simulating traffic flow. The model is designed to study the behavior of vehicular traffic on a single-lane road, accounting for parameters such as road length, number of cars, maximum speed, and probability of random slowdown.

This work was prepared by Maksim Prusakov for the Advanced Scientific Seminar on Theoretical Physics at TU Dresden in the Winter semester 2024/2025.
